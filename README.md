# Electricity Price Tracker Application

Welcome to the Electricity Price Tracker application! This single-page application fetches electricity price data from the current date back to 7 days. It provides information about the electricity prices for different hours of each day.

## Technologies Used

The application is built using the following technologies:

- [ASP.NET Core](https://get.asp.net/) and C# for cross-platform server-side code
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for client-side code
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for layout and styling

## Getting Started

To build and run the ASP.NET React.js application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/venlahelena/ElectricityPriceTracker.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd ElectricityPriceTracker

3. Install the necessary dependencies for the server-side code:
dotnet restore

4. Change to the client-side directory:

6. Build the client-side code:
npm run build

7. Go back to the project root directory:
